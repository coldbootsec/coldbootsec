# Hey, I’m @coldbootsec

I build open source security tools that help catch misconfigurations before they hit production.  
Focused on DevSecOps, cloud infrastructure, and automation for people who ship real systems.

## What I Work On

- IAM policy scanning and enforcement
- Secure cloud infrastructure and CI pipelines
- Kubernetes hardening and observability
- Zero Trust architecture for production environments
- OSS-first security workflows and compliance tooling

## Projects

- [secure-iam-lint](https://github.com/coldbootsec/secure-iam-lint)  
  A simple CLI and CI-friendly scanner to catch risky IAM policies before they’re deployed

- More tools coming soon  
  You’ll know when they drop

## Security Philosophy

Security should be built-in, not tacked on.  
Least privilege should be the default.  
Good security scales with automation, not headcount.  
Make the secure path the easy one.
